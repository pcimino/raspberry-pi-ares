# Using Raspberry Pi as a Dedicated Ares 2 Enyo Nodejs Server #

**Note**: You could use this tutorial for any Debian Linux setup to do the same thing. And the disk images are a useful shortcut if you want to start with a new Raspberry Pi image and setup VNC or Node.  

If you want to know [the WHY behind this project](http://pcimino.blog.com/?p=55)...

Then I wondered if it's powerful enough to be a dedicated [Ares 2](https://github.com/enyojs/ares-project) server. Ares is an open source, web based Enyo UI  tool, allowing you to drag and drop widgets, wire up events and actions, [here's a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=qQkzUDtiC-I).

This repository details the steps I took to create my server setup. [You can start byt looking at the wiki here.](https://github.com/pcimino/raspberry-pi-ares/wiki)  

The [Disk Images](https://github.com/pcimino/raspberry-pi-ares/tree/master/images) provide you with installable images to help you setup your Raspberry Pi (RPi).
